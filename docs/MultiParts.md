# Problem
The experimental pattern is the heart.

To build it, first one hump is crocheted, then the user starts working on the second hump from a new magic ring, and joins those 2 together.

Allowing multiple MRs introduces problems:
- which node should be the root?
- should there even be a root?
  - yes, Plushies may fly offscreen otherwise
  - but another way is to lock at least one point in space
